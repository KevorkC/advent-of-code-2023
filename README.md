# Advent of Code 2023
I am learning the Go programming language, by solving problems provided in this year's [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) calendar. This repository represents my endeavor to tackle these challenges.

## Overview
The repository is organized as follows:

- Each day's puzzle has its own file, named `day01.go`, `day02.go`, and so forth. 
- Some days may have two parts, which will be named `day01p2.go`, `day02p2.go`, etc.
- Each day may have a specific data file, which will be located in the `files` directory.

## Running the Solutions

To execute a specific day's solution, such as `day01.go`, follow these steps:

```bash
cd advent-of-code-2023
go run src/day01.go
